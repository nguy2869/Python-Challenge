# Python-Challenge
#In this homework assignment I worked with two real-world data sets,
#one was a bank data, and the other was voting data. 
#In the PyBank I created a code that would: count the total months, sum up the 
#total amount of net profits and loss over the entire period, also calculating 
#the average change of the loss and profits, then also calculate the greatest increase 
#and the greatest decrease in the bank.
#In the PyPoll I created a code that would: count the total votes casted, 
#and then for each candidate, the percentage of votes they received and the number of votes 
#each candidate recieved and then who the winner was overall.
